# AI Movie Character
This is a script which allows you to fine tune an LLM to make it sound like any movie character, based on movie scripts. For now, I have only tried a movie script from American Psycho. Due to copyright I cannot share any movie scripts here. Also, it does require some manual preprocessing for the helper functions to work. Originally, I did have a helper function which automated the process of creating a JSON Lines file from the raw pdf file. However, it was not perfect and lead to some weird errors in the generated output.
